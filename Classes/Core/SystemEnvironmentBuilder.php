/**
 * Class that replaces the core's SystemEnvironmentBuilder.
 *
 * It is used to adapt the default bootstrap to the requirements of the
 * Testing Framework, basically enforcing the created TYPO3 instances to not
 * be in Composer mode, so that the PackageManager reads PackageStates.php even in TYPO3 v11
 *
 * The TYPO3 testing instances that are set up by the testing framework are created by linking
 * folders and entry scripts. This makes these instances non Composer instances by definition.
 * However, since at the same time the autoload.php from the root installation is pulled in
 * and this sets a PHP constant, we need to make sure to override this environment property
 * for each created testing instance. This is done by overriding the Core SystemEnvironmentBuilder
 * with a custom one, which sets Composer Mode to false.
 *
 * All that can be removed, once the testing framework creates testing instances using Composer
