/**
 * If a TYPO3 extension should be tested, the extension needs to be embedded in
 * a TYPO3 instance. The composer.json file of the extension then acts as a
 * root composer.json file that creates a TYPO3 project around the extension code
 * in a build folder like "./.Build". The to-test extension then needs to reside
 * in ./.Build/Web/typo3conf/ext. This composer script takes care of this operation
 * and links the current root directory as "./<web-dir>/typo3conf/ext/<extension-key>".
 *
 * This class is added as composer "script" in TYPO3 extensions:
 *
 *   "scripts": {
 *     "post-autoload-dump": [
 *       "@prepare-extension-test-environment"
 *     ],
 *     "prepare-extension-test-structure": [
 *       "TYPO3\TestingFramework\Composer\ExtensionTestEnvironment::prepare"
 *     ]
 *   },
 *
 * It additionally needs the "extension key" (that will become the directory name in
 * typo3conf/ext) and the name of the target directory in the extra section. Example for
 * a extension "my_cool_extension":
 *
 *   "extra": {
 *     "typo3/cms": {
 *       "web-dir": ".Build/Web",
 *       "extension-key": "my_cool_extension"
 *     }
 *   }
