# TYPO3 testing framework for core and extensions

A straight and slim set of classes and configuration to test TYPO3 extensions. This framework is
used by the core, too and maintained by the core team as a base to execute unit, functional
and acceptance tests within the TYPO3 extension ecosystem.

## Installation

This framework works on top of a composer based installation.

```
$ composer require typo3/testing-framework
```

## Documentation

Usage examples within core and for extensions can be found in
[TYPO3 explained](https://docs.typo3.org/typo3cms/CoreApiReference/Testing/Index.html).
